## Introduction

This project is intended to be used by the (modding) community, mostly (but not limited to) games. Whenever 
there arises the need to manage content, e.g. mods or songs for a game, then GCM can be used as a baseline to 
setup a content manager. 

The main goal of this project is to be simple, yet provide enough functionality to be helpful in creating 
strong tooling. 

## Features

### planned (or rather: TODOs)

* allow custom backends
* usable CLI to download and manage content
* documentation and example implementation 

### future

* GUI

In the current state the project is more of a fun Rust hacking project. If you want to join in feel free 
to open issues with feature requests and/or PR's.
